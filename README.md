This project is a modern, animated navigation bar built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It features a smooth-moving circular indicator that highlights the active menu item. 
CSS handles the styling and animation, while JavaScript updates 
the active state dynamically when a user clicks on a menu item.
